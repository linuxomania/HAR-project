# Human Activity Recognition Project
Human activity recognition has wide applications in medical research and human survey
systems. In this project, we design a robust activity recognition system based on a smartphone.
The system uses a 3-dimensional smartphone accelerometer and a gyroscope as the sensors to
collect time-series signals, from which 31 features are generated in both time and frequency
domain.

Activities are classified into 6 different categories, i.e, walking, walking downstairs,
walking upstairs, sitting, standing, lying. These activities are predicted using 5 different passive
learning methods, i.e., logistic regression algorithm, k-nearest neighbors algorithm, Gaussian
naive bayes algorithm, random forest classifier.
Dimensionality reduction is performed through both feature extraction and subset
selection. Experiment results show that the classification rate of passive learning reaches
95.8% and it is robust to common positions and poses of the cell phone.

## Problem Statement:
Statement: John wants to find out the amount of calories he is burning everyday, for this, he
needs to know the various activities heâ€™s doing all day using the means of his smartphone. In
order to do this he collects the Accelerometer and Gyroscope readings built into his smartphone
and applies several machine learning algorithms to find out the best algorithm to predict and
classify his daily activities.
  
  Human activity recognition is the problem of classifying sequences of accelerometer data
recorded by specialized harnesses or smart phones into known well-defined movements.
  
  It is a challenging problem given the large number of observations produced each second,
the temporal nature of the observations, and the lack of a clear way to relate accelerometer data
to known movements.

## Objective :
Human Activity Recognition integrates the emerging area of sensor networks with novel
data mining and machine learning techniques to model a wide range of human activities.Mobile
devices (e.g. smartphones) provide sufficient sensor data and calculation power to enable
physical activity recognition to provide an estimation of the energy consumption during
everyday life. Sensor-based activity recognition researchers believe that by empowering
ubiquitous computers and sensors to monitor the behavior of agents (under consent), these
computers will be better suited to act on our behalf.
